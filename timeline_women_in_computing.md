ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer) - First fully electronic computer
Initial **6**

The very first group of computer programmers for the very first fully electronic computer ENIAC is composed of 6 women. Togehter they laid the groundwork for future programmers from zero.

Received NO recognition of the pioneering effort
> Women's job must not be hard to accomplish

Never introduced to the press on ENIAC's public debut on Feb 16th, 1946.
Weren't invited to the Army dinner celebrating the debut.

## 1949

**Grace Hopper** started working as a senior mathematician in Eckertâ€“Mauchly Computer Corporation and served as UNIVAC director of Automatic Programming Development for Remington Rand. UNIVAC is the first known large-scale electronic computer to be on the market. When Hopper recommended the development of a new programming language that would use entirely English words, she "was told very quickly that (she) couldn't do this because computers didn't understand English." Her idea was not accepted for 3 year.

## 1950

**Kathleen Booth** created Assembly Language, a low-level symbolic programming language.

## 1952

**Grace Hopper** **A-0**: First compiler for eletronic computers 
> "Nobody believed that...I had a running compiler and nobody would touch it, they told me computers could only do arithmetic." 

## 1954

**Grace Hopper** designed a computer language **FLOWMATIC**, an evolved verison from A-0, also aknown as **A-3**.

## 1959

**Grace Hopper** designed a computer language call **COBOL** (common business oriented language), which is still widely used in mainframe computer nowadays, especially by the banks and goveronments.

## 1969

**Margaret Hamilton** developed on-board flight software for the Apollo space program that averted an abort of landing on the moon. Hamilton's work is described as "the foundation for ultra-reliable software design". Margaret also coined the terminology and concept "Software Engineering" during working for Apollo program, she believed that software development should be considered, not as an attachement of hardware, but as an independent academic descipline.

## 2019

**Katie Bouman** led the development of an algorithm for imaging black holes. However, her achievement and contribution is doubted by misogynist communities on the internet. A video, pushed by a "men's right" community, riddled with inaccuracies, and largely draws from a falsehood created on Reddit appeared on the top search result with keyword "Katie Bouman" the day after Kaite was known to the world for leading the algorithm development imaging black holes. Hours later a similar search showed that the video was no longer appearing at the top of YouTube's results.
