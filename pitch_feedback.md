> In general a tons of insightful advice and inspiring ideas received.

1. A retrospect of women's role in Computer Science / Software Industry starte from **1960** - there is a paper there does this, a further conclusion with more data pluged in would be good.
2. A comparison of women's industry workforce/job ratio and women in science major in post-secondary eduction.
3. Girls' opportuniry in tech as a younger age - elementary school, middle school, high school - AP Computer Science Test?
4. Comparison of gender ratio between Software Industry and other industry
5. **Data from Stevens - gender ratio hiriing faulty in engineering/CS major, interview/survey for students at Stevens**
6. Why women ratio stays low despite of many pushed for women in tech
7. **Tech opportunities in HS have an effect on how many women end up in tech - something to consider**
8. Pay gap [probably hard to find data]
