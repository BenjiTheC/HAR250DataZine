## Bachelorâ€™s Degrees Earned by Women, by Major

> **Link**: https://www.aps.org/programs/education/statistics/womenmajors.cfm

### Summary

This dataset collects the data of number of men and women who were awarded Bachelor's Degrees in different engineering major every year from 1967 to 2017. It also contains an visualization part which plots the percentage of women who earned Bachelor's Degrees in different major throughout these 50 years.

### Relation to the topic

The data is related to the topic **"Women in Software Industry"** as it contains the data of Bachelor's Degrees awarded to women in Computer Science major. Unlike the other majors, the data for CS major only started to be gathered from 1987. But it still shows a obvious trend of women being underrepresented in the CS major. The percentage of women who earned CS Bachelor's Degree started from a high point - over **30%** in 1987, and has been keeping dropping over the years. At the start of 21 century, there is a major drop of percentage that brought the percentage down to less than 20% from nearly 30%

### Interesting Finding

Unlike percentage of women awarded CS Bachelor's Degrees, there are two engineering majors, Chemistry and Biology, of which women have taken up the majority. The percentage of women earning Bachelor's Degrees in Chemistry started from about 18% in 1967 and reached 50% in 2017, where as Biology started from 30% and reached 63% in 2017. Academically these two majors are actually highly coupled which potentially means that the growth of percentage in these two major has an inner connection.

Also, across all majors, the percentage has a major drop at the start of 21st century, this trend is worth for a deeper dive.

## Doctoral Degrees Earned by Women, by Major

### Summary

This dataset collects the data of number of men and women who were awarded Doctoral Degrees in different engineering major every year from 1967 to 2017. It also contains an visualization part which plots the percentage of women who earned Doctoral Degrees in different major throughout these 50 years.

### Relation to the topic

I tried to explore more data from the education part instead of staring at only professional area, as I believe the result of women being underrepresented is caused by a deeper root cause. Shown in the diagram, despite of a large fluctuation throughout the years, the percentage of women awarded Doctoral degrees in CS major has gradually increased: started from 15% and reached 22%. It's still not enough but it's increasing.

### Interesting Finding

Shown in diagram, **from 1967 to 2017, percentage of women awarded Doctoral Degrees of all majors have grew. And all PhDs earned by women has reached 50% in 2017**. Comparing to the data from Bachelor's Degree, there may be some interesting reason underlays.
